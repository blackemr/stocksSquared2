            <p class="lead">This web application will allow retail traders to discuss strategies in a forum structure. Our system will allow users to create accounts and login. Users will recieve stock market data without logging into the site.

                Once a user logs in, they can submit trading strategies that have to be approved by a moderator on our site.

                The users have the ability to search, filter, and sort trading strategies.

                Our site will contain a discussion board which will be attached to the individual strategies.
