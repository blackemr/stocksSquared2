# Stocks Squared

## Project by: Beck Svaren, Matt Blackert, Edward Melsher, Yufan Yang, and Christian Castellon.

This web application will allow retail traders to discuss strategies in a forum structure. Our system will allow users to create accounts and login. Users will recieve stock market data without logging into the site. 

Once a user logs in, they can submit trading strategies that have to be approved by a moderator on our site. 

The users have the ability to search, filter, and sort trading strategies. 

Our site will contain a discussion board which will be attached to the individual strategies.
